	<h1>Movie reviews</h1>
	<article>
	<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><q> Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of
		<br> the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but
		<br> the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.
	</q></p>
	
	<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><q>I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their
		<br> families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.</q></p>
